In spring 2008, when the club was re-established after a 25 year break, I was approached by the club's management and asked to participate in a closed logo design contest. My logo, which incorporated letter D from the original club's logo as well as symbols from the Latvian coat of arms, won among proposals by several of the largest advertising agencies in the country. I continued to work with them for the first half of their first season -- designing player jerseys, fan merchandising etc. When the club's management changed halfway into the season, they took over the design part too.&nbsp;",
