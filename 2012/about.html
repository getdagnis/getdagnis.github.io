    </div>
    <p>As far as the makers of this website are concerned, the best you could ever know about Dagnis Skurbe is that he is an Art Director coming, probably, from a planet millions of miles away from England and so far in his life has been working for creatures that might or might not be three-headed aliens overlooking a distant galactic cattle-farm somewhere in the Universe. However, it is well known that Dagnis has just moved to UK and is seeking a middle to senior level job offer in an advertising or design agency in <strong><span class="red">London</span></strong>.</p>
    <p>This is a showcase of works he&rsquo;s been doing for all the alien cosmic cattle-farmers so far. So be sure to contact Dagnis for an interview if you like them. You may do so by writing to <script type="text/javascript">
		  document.write(
		  '<b><a href="mailto:' + dbc + '">' + dbc + '</a></b>'
		  )
		  </script>.

      And since there&rsquo;s no other creature in the known part of the Universe sharing the same name and surname, you will also find it rather easy to locate him on Facebook.</p>
